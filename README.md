###Description
This is an example application that showcases the push capability of RethinkDB in a very simplistic app using RethinkDB, Node.JS, and Socket.IO.

Through the app, a user can register a user name or save a message in the RethinkDB database.  The app is configurated to listen to receive the push notifications from RethinkDB when a user name or message is saved.

The supporting blog is located at [keyholesoftware.com].

NPM and NODE.jS is required before setting up and running the application.

Frameworks used:
<ul>
  <li>RethinkDB as the database</li>
  <li>Node.JS as the backend server</li>
  <li>Socket.IO for the communication channel between the server and the client and vice versa</li>
  <li>JQuery on the client just to keep it simple</li>
</ul>

###Setup
Run the following commands to start:
<ol>
  <li>npm install</li>
  <li>node server.js</li>
  <li>Open one browser for User1 and browse to: http://localhost:3000</li>
  <li>Open another browser for User2 and browse to: http://localhost:3000</li>
</ol>
**due to a bug in the app, the first time running 'node server.js' will throw an error.  The subsequent node runs will be fine.
